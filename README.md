# MedVerify

**MedVerify** is a public health prototype app designed to combat the distribution of counterfeit and substandard medicines in Pakistan and other LMICs. Built with React Native and integrated with barcode scanning technology, the app allows users to scan medicine packaging and verify its authenticity in real-time.

---

##  Features

-  **Barcode Scanner** using device camera
-  **Verification Result Screen** showing medicine status
-  **Mock Google Sheets Backend** (replaceable with real health authority database)
-  Future plans for API integration with official regulatory bodies

---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Git

### Install

##  How It Works

1. User opens the app and scans the barcode on medicine packaging.
2. The app checks the barcode against a Google Sheet (mock backend).
3. It returns a message indicating whether the medicine is verified and safe.
